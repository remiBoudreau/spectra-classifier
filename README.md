# spectra-classifier
Machine learning classifier for filtering viable targets from spectral data from chip as a preprocessing step in XFEL data acquisition. Refer to [this paper](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?gm5046) to get an idea of the origin for this project. At its current state, the code tranforms using UMAPS and clusters the data with DBSCAN. Trained model upcoming.

The following code is a work in progress.
