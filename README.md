# spectra-classifier

WORK IN PROGRESS.

Machine learning classifier for filtering viable targets from UV spectral data from chip as a preprocessing step in XFEL data acquisition. Refer to [this paper](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?gm5046) to get an idea of the origin for this project. At its current state, the code tranforms UV data using UMAPS and clusters the embeddings with DBSCAN. Trained model on approx 11,500 UV spectra upcoming.

The following code is a work in progress.
